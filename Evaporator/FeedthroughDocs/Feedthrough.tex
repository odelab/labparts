\paragraph{Project:} NanoLab Evaporator Source Feedthrough
\paragraph{Goal:} To create an electrical feedthrough for a joule heating-based evaporative source. It must hold two sources at the height of the window in the chamber. All the electrical paths must be able to carry 400W, and everything in the chamber must be stable in high vacuum. There must also be a shield to prevent the sources from depositing on each other.

\paragraph{Engineering Work:}
In the first design, we used only one source which simplified the problem. We didn't need to worry about two feedthroughs and the interference between two sources. Here are the drawings for those parts. They are made of solid copper rod.
